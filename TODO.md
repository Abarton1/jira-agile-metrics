### Blocked time

Note: this is harder to do, and maybe we will never get the data close to right

- Find tickets in cycle time data
- Window (months)
- Record entry and exit to the "flagged" status, plus reason (free text?), as "blocking event"
- Store: Ticket, blocking event, reason, start date, end date (if resolved)
- Stacked bar chart: For each month, how many days total on blocking events, grouped by status
